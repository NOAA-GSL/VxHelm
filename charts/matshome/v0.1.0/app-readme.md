#MATSHOME
MATSHOME is an app that serves as a landing page for all the MATS apps that are deployed to a specific namespace.

This chart requires the pre-allocation of a Persistent Volume Claim with minimum 10GB of storage space where MATSMONGO, MATSHOME, and a set of MATS apps are deployed. 
This volume claim will provide persistance for matsmongo and will also be shared to any MATS apps that are deployed into the same namespace.

This chart requires the existence of a matsmongo deployed into the target namespace.
The MATSHOME app uses the PVC to look up persisted settings that are generated by each deployed MATS app. Using these settings MATSHOME can render a landing page for the namespace. MATSHOME is the prescribed entry point for all of the MATS apps deployed within a given namespace.
