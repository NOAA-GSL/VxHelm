#MATSHOME
MATSHOME is an app that serves as a landing page for all the MATS apps that are deployed to a namespace.

This chart requires the pre-allocation of a Storage Class that the chart can use to allocate a dynamic Persistent Volume Claim.
A Persistent Volume Claim with minimum 10GB of storage space will be allocated for each namespace into
which MATSMONGO, a cooresponding MATSHOME, and a set of MATS apps are deployed. 
This volume claim will provide persistance for matsmongo and will also be shared to any MATS apps that are deployed into the same namespace.

In the event that either a MATSMONGO or MATS app has already been deployed to the namespace this chart will use that Persisted Volume and create a new one.
The chart is intended to be deployed into a specific namespace in a [Rancher](https://rancher.com/) environment.

The MATSHOME app uses the PVC to look up persisted settings that are generated by each deployed MATS app. Using these settings MATSHOME can render a landing page for the namespace. MATSHOME is the prescribed entry point for all of the MATS apps deployed within a given namespace.
